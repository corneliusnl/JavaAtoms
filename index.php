<h2>Introduction</h2>
Java'ed Atoms was a program intended to be written in the Java
programming language that would allow you to view atoms in
real-time 3D animation.  The program would read a database,
containing all the information as given from the periodic table,
with this information it would create a 3D representation,
which would animate as the electrons whizzed around the
nucleus.  However, due to time constraints, the program is
being released to the general public in the hope that someone
might continue where I left off.
